      "\n",
      "Registry hives have a defined structure\n",
      "\n",
      "The file, and external container, is called a hive. Each hive contains the following data:\n",
      "- Root\n",

      "- Key\n",
      "  - This is an entry in the registry that contains values. \n",

      "## Key Objects\n",
      "\n",
      "Since a key can contain keys or values anything could be inside of it. This library handles this by allowing any value or key to be called from a key object by using `.value('name of value')` to return a value by name or `.subkey('name of key')` to return a key by name. To get all of the available values, run `.values()` against the key object, and for the available subkeys, run `.subkeys()`. Both of these methods will return a list of value/key objects to then interract with further.\n",

These functions can get tricky as they are similar to the options available to the Key objects above. The data within a value can come in several forms, including int, str, hex, bin, unicode, and more. Be ready to handle some weird data when pulling information from the registry - especially from shadow volumes or recovered registry hives. \n",
